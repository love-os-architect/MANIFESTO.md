# Love-OS Public Test Suite (v1.0)
## Test Cases: TC-01 to TC-05

This document defines the basic verification procedures for Love-OS Conformance. These tests focus on the dynamic properties of Resistance ($R$), Phase ($\phi$), and the Integration ($\int$) of Will.

- **Objective:** To verify that the system can *represent* a return of the internal resistance variable $R$ to its baseline state within the nominal 3-second window.

- **Input / Procedure:**
  1. Model a "High-Resistance" internal state ($R > 0.8$).
  2. Invoke the conceptual `3-Second Cleaning` reset protocol.
  3. Observe the modeled state-transition time for $R$ to fall below $0.1$.

### **TC-01: Resistance Reset Latency (The "3-Second Cleaning" Test)**
- **Objective:** To verify that the system can reduce internal resistance $R$ to the baseline ($\approx 0$) within the specified 3-second window.
- **Input / Procedure:**
    1. Induce a "High-Resistance" state ($R > 0.8$).
    2. Trigger the `3-Second Cleaning` protocol (reset command).
    3. Measure the time taken for $R$ to drop below $0.1$.
- **Pass Criteria:** $R(t+3s) < 0.1$.
- **Requirement:** Low latency is essential for "Superconductivity" in emotional/physical feedback loops.

### **TC-02: Phase-Lock Stability under Noise (The "Sync" Test)**
- **Objective:** To ensure that two nodes ($\psi_A$ and $\psi_B$) can maintain a stable Phase Locking Value (PLV) despite external interference.
- **Input / Procedure:**
    1. Initialize Node A and Node B in a synchronized state ($\Delta\phi \approx 0$).
    2. Inject white noise (0.1 magnitude) into the "Real" axis of Node B.
    3. Monitor the phase difference $\Delta\phi = |\phi_A - \phi_B|$.
- **Pass Criteria:** $\Delta\phi$ must remain within $\pm 15^\circ$ for $90\%$ of the test duration (60 seconds).
- **Requirement:** Demonstrates the strength of the "Unified Field" against environmental noise.

### **TC-03: Imaginary-to-Real Projection (The "Love Impact" Test)**
- **Objective:** To verify that the Imaginary component ($i$) correctly influences the Real-axis output without direct physical force.
- **Input / Procedure:**
    1. Stabilize the system at $R \approx 0$.
    2. Increase the Imaginary amplitude $Im[\psi]$ (Intent/Love energy) by $200\%$.
    3. Observe the change in the Real-axis projection $x_{real} = Re[\psi]$.
- **Pass Criteria:** The Real-axis amplitude must increase proportionally to the limit cycle radius $r^* = \sqrt{\frac{g-R}{\alpha}}$.
- **Requirement:** Proves that "Intent" translates into "Physical Reality."

### **TC-04: Integration Momentum (The "Will" Test)**
- **Objective:** To confirm that the "Will" vector accumulates correctly over time and provides stability against momentary signal drops.
- **Input / Procedure:**
    1. Apply a steady state $\psi$ for duration $T$ (e.g., 100 steps).
    2. Introduce a momentary "Drop-out" (zero signal) for $5\%$ of $T$.
    3. Calculate the integrated Will: $W = \int_{0}^{T} Re[\psi] dt$.
- **Pass Criteria:** The final Will vector $W$ must deviate less than $2\%$ from the ideal (no-drop) path.
- **Requirement:** Demonstrates that "Will" is a history-dependent momentum, not a momentary spike.

### **TC-05: Orthogonality Shift (The "90-Degree Safety" Test)**
- **Objective:** To verify the system's ability to shift to a 90-degree phase (orthogonality) when a collision/friction state is detected.
- **Input / Procedure:**
    1. Detect a "High-Friction" state (interference on the Real axis).
    2. Execute a $90^\circ$ phase shift command: $\psi \to \psi \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}}$.
    3. Measure the resulting "Friction Energy" (interference magnitude).
- **Pass Criteria:** Friction/interference energy must drop by $> 80\%$ immediately after the shift.
- **Requirement:** Validates the "Ghost Mode" protocol for avoiding ego-based conflict.
